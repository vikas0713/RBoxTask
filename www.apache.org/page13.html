<p>This document outlines the <strong>policy for allowable uses of Apache&reg; trademarks by other parties</strong>.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) owns all Apache-related
trademarks, service marks, and graphic logos on behalf of our Apache project communities, and 
the <strong>names of all Apache projects are trademarks of the ASF</strong>.</p>
<p>The following information helps ensure our marks and logos are used in

as well as encouraging the use of Apache software and our brands in approved 
ways by third parties. You may <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/contact">contact us</a> with any questions 
about this policy or any Apache trademarks, and please <strong>read our

<h1 id="rationale">Rationale<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Apache&reg; trademarks, service marks, and graphics marks are symbols of the
quality and community support that people have come to associate with
projects of the ASF. To ensure that the use of Apache
marks will not lead to confusion about our software, we must control their
use in association with software and related services by other organizations.
Also, as a US based corporation, we have a legal responsibility and the
authority to set policy for the use of our marks.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation and our many software products must be clearly
distinguishable from any software that competes with ASF software, and from
software or services by any company or individual that is not part of
the ASF.</p>
<p>Apache trademarks must not be used to disparage the Apache Software Foundation, our
projects, members, sponsors, or communities, nor be used in any way to imply
ownership, endorsement, or sponsorship of any ASF-related project or
initiative of any kind.  As a vendor-neutral organization, an important part of 
our brand is that <a href="//community.apache.org/projectIndependence">Apache projects are governed independently</a>.</p>
<h1 id="principles">Description of Key Trademark Principles<a class="headerlink" href="#principles" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>This section is not intended to summarize the complex law of trademarks.
It will be useful, however, to understand some key principles.  More 
information is on our <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/resources">trademark resources listing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is a trademark?</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>trademark</strong> is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of
words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the
source of the goods of one party from those of others. A <strong>service mark</strong>
is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the
source of a service rather than a product. Throughout this document,
the terms "trademark" and "mark" refer to both trademarks and service
marks.</p>
<p>These rules are generalized to describe ASF software associated with the
trademark "Apache <em>ProjectName</em>", or more generally "<em>ProjectName</em>" when it is understood to
refer to our specific Apache <em>ProjectName</em> software product. Like most ASF software, this
<em>ProjectName</em> software is maintained by the Apache <em>ProjectName</em> project, or by the <em>ProjectName</em>
sub-project of another project, such as the "Apache Incubator" (itself an
ASF trademark).</p>
<p>ASF's trademarks are either words (e.g., "Apache" and "Apache <em>ProjectName</em>" and
"<em>ProjectName</em>") or graphic logos that are intended to serve as trademarks for that
Apache software. The Apache feather is also an ASF trademark for Apache
software which has special meaning for ASF and special rules regarding its
use.</p>
<p>Within the ASF, during our product release activity and on ASF websites, we
will make sure that our trademarks are marked with a (TM) or (R) symbol or
shown with trademark notices where appropriate so that everyone will
recognize them as ASF trademarks, and by providing a <a href="list">list of ASF
trademarks</a>, and we provide a <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/guide">detailed guide for how to refer to Apache brands</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is nominative use?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone can use ASF trademarks if that use of the trademark is nominative.
The "nominative use" (or "nominative fair use") defense to trademark
infringement is a legal doctrine that authorizes everyone (even commercial
companies) to use another person's trademark as long as three requirements
are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable
without use of the trademark; (for example, it is not easy to identify
Apache Hadoop&reg; software without using the trademark "Hadoop")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary
to identify the product or service; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organization using the mark must do nothing that would, in
conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the
trademark holder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The trademark nominative fair use defense is intended to encourage people
to refer to trademarked goods and services by using the trademark itself.
This trademark defense has nothing to do with copyright fair use and should
not be confused with those rules.</p>
<p><strong>What is the "confusing similarity" or "likelihood of confusion" test?</strong></p>
<p>Some uses of another person's trademark are nominative fair use, but some
uses are simply infringing. Indeed, if a trademark is used in such a way
that the relevant consuming public will likely be confused or mistaken
about the source of a product or service sold or provided using the mark in
question, then likelihood of confusion exists and the mark has been
infringed.</p>
<p>Note that, even if there is no likelihood of confusion, you may still be
liable for using another company's trademark if you are blurring or
tarnishing their mark under the state and/or federal dilution laws.</p>
<p>To avoid infringing ASF's marks, you should verify that your use of our
marks is nominative and that you are not likely to confuse software
consumers that your software is the same as ASF's software or is endorsed
by ASF. This policy is already summarized in section 6 of the <a href="/licenses/">Apache
License</a> , and so it is a condition for your use of Apache
software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="guidelines">Specific Apache Trademark Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#guidelines" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The following Specific Policies apply to the "Apache" word trademark and
the "Apache feather" graphic trademark, as well as the trademarks and
graphic logos for all "Apache <em>ProjectName</em>" and "<em>ProjectName</em>" software produced by each
of the ASF's projects.  You may refer to our 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/list/">list of Apache marks</a>. </p>
<p>Examples of permitted nominative fair use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>" Free copies of Apache <em>ProjectName</em> software under the Apache License and support
services for Apache <em>ProjectName</em> are available at my own company website. "</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>" Derivative works of Apache <em>ProjectName</em> software and support services for those
derivative works are available under my own trademarks at my website. "
Please remember that, under trademark law, you may not apply trademarks to
your derivative works of <em>ProjectName</em> software that are confusingly similar to "<em>ProjectName</em>"
or "Apache <em>ProjectName</em>" or the <em>ProjectName</em> graphic logo trademarks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>" <em>ProjectName</em> software is faster (or slower) than Myco software. "</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>" I recommend (or don't recommend) <em>ProjectName</em> software for your business. "</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>" This &lt;here&gt; is the graphic logo for Apache <em>ProjectName</em> software. "</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ASF prefers you use the <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/guide">full Apache <em>ProjectName</em> name</a> for all our projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="products">Using Apache Trademarks in software product branding<a class="headerlink" href="#products" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In general you may <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/#products"><strong>not</strong> use Apache trademarks in any software product branding</a>. 
However in very specific situations you may use the <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/#poweredby">Powered By naming form</a> for software products. </p>
<h2 id="books">Using Apache Trademarks in published books and articles<a class="headerlink" href="#books" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You may write about Apache Foo software, and use our trademarks in book or
article titles. You needn't ask us for permission to refer to Foo (ProjecName), as in
"Foo for Dummies", or "Explaining Foo", or "Foo Simplified", or "O'Reilly
Guide to Foo", or even "Avoiding Foo".</p>
<p>We prefer that you refer to "Apache Foo" rather than simply "Foo" in the
title if it fits, and we request that you clearly identify that "Apache",
"Apache Foo", and "Foo" are trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation
wherever you normally acknowledge important trademarks in your book or
article.</p>
<p>For more details, please see our <a href="faq/#booktitle">FAQ about Apache marks in publishing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Apache feather logo to identify ASF and link to
<a href="/">www.apache.org</a> :</strong></p>
<p>The Apache feather logo is a special trademark to the members of the Apache
Software Foundation and we intend to prevent its use in association with
other companies' software or related services.</p>
<p>You needn't ask us for permission to use the Apache feather logo (the
version published by us <a href="/foundation/press/kit/">here</a> ) on your own
website solely as a hyperlink to <a href="/">www.apache.org</a> or to an appropriate Apache project, or in other materials, 
such as presentations and slides, solely as a means to refer to the ASF itself.</p>
<p>All other uses of the Apache feather logo must be <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/contact#other">approved in writing</a> by
the VP, Apache Brand Management or by a member of the Brand Management Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Using the Apache Foo or similar project graphic logos:</strong></p>
<p>Graphic logos are contributed to ASF by artists as a way of creating a
symbol with which the Apache project software can be identified. Examples
of logos are the Hadoop elephant, the SpamAssassin arrow, or even the
graphic way that the word "Maven" is spelled with an orange letter "a".
Those graphic logos are special to the Apache projects that mark their
software and their project websites with those logos.</p>
<p>You needn't ask us for permission to use Apache's graphics logos (the
versions published on individual project's websites) on your own website
solely as a hyperlink to the specific Apache project website or to
<a href="/">www.apache.org</a>. All other uses of Apache Foo (and similar) graphic
logos must be <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/contact">approved in writing</a> by VP, Apache Brand Management,
member of the Brand Management Committee, or the relevant Apache 
projects' VP.</p>
<p>Unlike ASF's word trademarks (such as "Apache" and "Foo"), our graphic
logos are also licensed to the public under the Apache License. That
license permits you to create derivative works of those logos, as with any
other Apache copyrighted work. However, trademark law does not allow you to
apply any "confusingly similar" derivative logo to software if a relevant
consumer would likely be confused by that use of that derivative logo.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the use of or changes to any
ASF graphic trademark, please <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/contact">contact us</a></p>
<p><strong>Using Apache trademarks on merchandise:</strong></p>
<p>You must obtain prior <a href="//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/contact#swag">written approval</a> from the VP, Apache Brand Management
or designee to apply the "Apache", "Apache Foo" or "Foo" trademarks or their graphic
logos to any merchandise that is intended to be associated in people's
minds with Apache Foo software or any Apache software.</p>
<p>Permission to apply ASF trademarks (including graphic logos) may be granted
for merchandise that promotes the Apache Software Foundation, the Apache
Foo project and Foo software.</p>
<p>Permission to apply ASF trademarks will ordinarily be denied for
merchandise that disparages Apache software or projects or that would serve
to detract from the value of Apache software and its brands.</p>
<p><strong>The following uses of ASF trademarks are probably infringing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confusingly similar software product names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software service offerings that are for anything other than official
ASF-distributed software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Company names that may be associated in customer's minds with ASF or its
trademarked project software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="domains">Using Apache Trademarks in domain names<a class="headerlink" href="#domains" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You may not use ASF trademarks such as "Apache" or "ApacheFoo" or "Foo" in
your own domain names if that use would be likely to confuse a relevant
consumer about the source of software or services provided through your
website, without written approval of the VP, Apache Brand Management or designee. You
should apply the "likelihood of confusion" test described above, and please
realize that the use of ASF trademarks in your domain names is generally not
"nominative fair use."</p>
<p>For more details and to request approvals, please see our 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/domains.html">Domain Name Branding Policy</a>. 
In particular, using Apache product names as second level domain names (<em>example</em>.com) is not allowed.</p>
<h2 id="events">Using Apache Trademarks in relation to conferences and events<a class="headerlink" href="#events" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Certain ASF trademarks are reserved exclusive for
official Apache Software Foundation activities. For example, "ApacheCon" is
our exclusive trademark for our regular ASF conferences, and the Apache
feather is intended for ASF use at events in which we participate.</p>
<p>Individual ASF projects (such as "Apache Foo") often create their own
conferences and events, or join with other organizations or companies to
hold joint conferences or events. Any conflicting use of ASF trademarks
(including trademarks related to our projects or products) in relation to
conferences or events must be approved in writing from the VP, Apache 
Brand Management or designee.</p>
<p>For more details and to request approvals, please see our 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/events.html">Event Branding Policy</a>. 
Please request approvals well in advance to avoid ApacheCon blackout dates.</p>
